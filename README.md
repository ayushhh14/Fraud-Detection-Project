# FRAUD DETECTION PROJECT
# Abstract

With the rapid growth of digital financial services, fraudulent transactions have become a major concern for financial institutions. Detecting fraud accurately and efficiently is challenging due to the large volume of transactions and highly imbalanced data. This project presents a machine learning–based fraud detection system that analyzes financial transaction data to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The system employs Logistic Regression with appropriate preprocessing and class imbalance handling. The trained model is deployed as a web-based application using Streamlit for real-time fraud prediction.

# Introduction

Online payment systems generate massive volumes of transactional data daily. While these systems provide convenience, they are also vulnerable to fraudulent activities. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to evolving fraud patterns. Machine learning techniques provide a data-driven approach to automatically learn patterns associated with fraudulent behavior.
This project focuses on designing and deploying an efficient fraud detection model using supervised learning techniques.

# Methodology

Built an end-to-end fraud detection system using machine learning to classify financial transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering, including encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, and handling class imbalance.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify fraud patterns across transaction types and amounts.

Trained a Logistic Regression model using a Scikit-learn pipeline with class weight balancing.

Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, achieving approximately 94% accuracy.

Deployed the trained model as an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time fraud prediction.
